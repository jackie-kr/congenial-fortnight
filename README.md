## Bloom: The app for people to bloom into their true selves.

Transitioning can feel like a daunting task, but our app is here to help you through every step of the way. Our features are designed to break down goals into manageable steps and keep you on track to becoming your best self. 

Now more than ever, the trans community needs to know accurate medical information and resources, to stay safe, and to find a loving and accepting community. Yet trans people often cannot find support in those closest to them, and the stigma around gender-affirming healthcare can make finding resources overwhelming. Bloom is here to help by providing a way to organize all your thoughts, feelings, and goals in one place, so you can find fullfilment in your journey and stay motivated.

Coming Soon: Our stealth mode feature hides the app icon and changes the name in your app library to one of your choice. Your journey is about you, and you should be free from external influences that keep you from being who you are.
